Bat

2015-10-07



Bat (Basic Tools) is an ensemble of basic tools that one can use to 
hopefully do a job faster (from the coding point of view, not performance).

A tool is a **static class**, which means that you can call its methods
without having to instantiate it.





So far, the Bat library is composed of the following tools:



Tools       |       Description
----------- | -----------------------
[FileSystemTool]( https://github.com/lingtalfi/Bat/blob/master/FileSystemTool.md )          |       Tools for the filesystem
[LocalHostTool](  https://github.com/lingtalfi/Bat/blob/master/LocalHostTool.md )          |       Tools aware of the local host
[StringTool]( https://github.com/lingtalfi/Bat/blob/master/StringTool.md )          |       Tools for string manipulation
